Variables
---------

Variable names consist of a letter followed by any number of letters, digits and
underscores. Versailles does not have reserved words like other languages.
Its syntax is such that words like ``let`` or ``def`` that are used elsewere in
the language can always be differentiated from variables of such names.

Every variable has a scope -- the portion of the source code where that
variable is accessible. The scope usually starts with the expression where
the variable appears first and ends at the end of the enclosing function or file.

The scope of two variables with the same name may overlap. This can be achieved 
by prefixing ``?`` (question mark) to the beginning and end of the scope of 
the inner variable. For example::
	
	let sum = 1 + 2;
	let ?sum = 10 + 20;
	let y = ?sum * 3;
	return (sum, y);
	
This returns ``(3, 90)``. Any outer variable is inaccessible as long as the
inner variable is visible. 

You can also define a variable and immediately close its scope. This is done
by giving it the special name ``_`` (underscore). This is sometimes useful when you get a 
value that you don't need and don't want to give it a proper name. 

Variable names that start with an upper case letter are typically used for 
types. The reason is that Versailles' syntax for types does not allow to 
easily use variables that start with lower case letter.

There is also a form for variables that allows to use any character. For 
example, you could define are variable with the plus sign as its name like so:
:literal:`\`+\``. Any sequence of characters is allowed between the backticks. 
This is also a way to access lower-cased variables in types.

Tuple Types (short form)
------------------------

A tuple is an ordered set of values. Tuples are written using parenthesis and 
commas. For example ``(1, "abc")`` is a pair of numbers containing the number ``1`` as
its first component and the string ``"abc"`` as its second component. A tuple can contain
any number of components, even zero. The components also can have different data
types. They can even be tuples again.

Tuples that contain only one component must have an extra comma to differentiate
them from simple parenthesis. For example ``(1)`` is just the number ``1``,
but ``(1,)`` is the tuple that contains the number one. Additional commas can 
be inserted anywhere in a tuple if you feel the need.

Tuple components can be given names. For example ``(x = 1, y = 2, z = 3)`` has
three components named ``x``, ``y`` and ``z``. Named and unnamed components 
can be mixed, but the unnamed components must always be in front of the named
components.

Tuple components can be accessed in two ways. First, the ``.``-operator can be
used to retrieve one of its components, either by its name (if it has one) or 
by its position (starting from zero). For example, let ``t = (1, "abc", b = true)``â€š
then ``t(1)`` returns ``"abc"`` and ``t.b`` returns ``true``. Named components
can of course also be accessed by their position. So, in the example ``t(2)`` is
equivalent to ``t.b``. 

The second way to access tuple components is with a pattern matching. So, for
example ``let (a, b, c) = t;`` would assign the three components of ``t`` to
the variables ``a``, ``b`` and ``c``. [TODO:named]
The pattern must match exactly the number of components that the tuple has or
the match fails. 
 
A tuple type defines the types for each component. For example, ``{Integer, String}`` 
is describes pairs of integers and strings. A tuple type may also describe
the names of its components. For example, ``{x: Integer, y: Integer, z: Integer}`` 
is a tuple type with three integer components with the names ``x``, ``y`` and ``z``.

The singleton tuple type is written ``{A,}``. Curly braces serve the same
grouping purpose for types as parenthesis do for values. So, if the comma is ommitted 
as in ``{A}`` the whole expression stand just for the type ``A``.

The empty tuple type is ``Unit`` (defined as ``tuple { pass }``, see next 
section) which is sometimes useful. Its only value is the empty tuple ``()``.

Tuples (long form)
-----------------------

Tuples and tuple types also have a more verbose form with more features. For example,
the tuple type ``{x: Integer, y: Integer, z: Integer}`` can also be written as::

	tuple {
	    def x: Integer;
	    def y: Integer;
	    def z: Integer;
	}
	
The long form for the tuple ``(x = 1, y = 2, z = 3)`` is::

    {
    	def x: Integer = 1;
    	def y: Integer = 2;
    	def z: Integer = 3;
    }
	
This form allows

* to document components using the :ref:`def-statement-values`
* computed members using the definite form of :ref:`def-statement-values`
* function members using :ref:`def-statement-functions`
* type components using :ref:`type-statement`
* local definititions using the :ref:`let-statement` 
* :ref:`if-statement` which may not depend on runtime values

Functions
---------

Functions are usually not written in the form explain in this section. Most 
functions are defined by using the :ref:`def-statement-functions`. You can
skip this section and still be able to write any program.

A function expression (or 'anonymous function' or 'lambda expression') is 
written ``a -> b`` where ``a`` and ``b`` can be any expression. ``a`` is called
the function's *pattern* and ``b`` is called its *body*. New variables
that appear in ``a`` will be assigned values that can then be used in ``b``.
Variables that are used in ``a`` must of course have been defined earlier -- 
either in ``a`` or in the outer scope.

.. note::

	If you want to define a variable in a function's pattern with the same name 
	of a variable that is already defined, you have to prefix its name with ``?``.
	See :ref:`variables`.

A function type describes the types of a function's input and output values.
A function type for functions that map values of type ``A`` to values of type
``B`` is written ``A -> B``. Even though the syntax of function types looks the
same here as that of function expressions, it is not. Since ``A`` and ``B`` are
types only type expression may appear in these places. So, variables that start
with lower case letters cannot be used, for example.  

Case-Expressions
----------------

A function can be defined by multiple cases that are tried in order. The first
matching case determines the function result. The following function, for example,
converts booleans to strings.::

	{
		case true => "true';
		case false => "false";
    } 

Januses (Reversible Functions)
------------------------------

A janus is a function that can be run in reverse. Reversible functions cannot
be dependently typed. A janus type replaces ``->`` with one of the following
symbols. 

``<>-<>``
	Generic Janus
	
	A generic janus, ``f: A <>-<> B`` has a reverse ``~f: B <>-<> A`` and that's
	it. Every janus is also a function, and so is its reverse.

``>->``
	Semi-inverse Janus

	If ``f(x)`` is defined then ``~f(f(x)) == x``.
	
``<-<``
	Cosemi-inverse Janus
	
	If ``~f(x)`` is defined then ``f(~f(x)) == x``.
	
``<->``
	Inverse Janus

	``f`` is semi-inverse and cosemi-inverse.
	
``<>->``
	Semi-pseudoinverse Janus
    
    If ``f(x)`` is defined then ``f(~f(f(x)) == x``.
    
``<-<>``
    Cosemi-pseudoinverse Janus
    
    If ``~f(x)`` is defined then ``~f(f(~f(x)) == x``.
	
``>-<``
    Pseudoinverse Janus

   ``f`` is semi-pseudoinverse and cosemi-pseudoinverse.
   
Dependent Functions
-------------------
   
A dependent function type is written with an extended arrow ``-->``. In this 
case, the argument is given as a tuple expression: ``(x: A) --> B(x)``.
This allows the result type of the function to depend on the actual value of 
the argument. The argument type is then the type of the argument expression. 
Otherwise ``A -> B`` is truly just an abbreviation of ``(_: A) --> B`` where 
the actual argument cannot not appear in ``B``.

Januses cannot have a dependent type.

There is no difference between the function expressions ``a --> b`` and ``a -> b``.
Function expressions don't need a special syntax to be dependently typed.
